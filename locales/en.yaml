  # PolAIn

  PolAin is a conversational application with AI (Artificial Intelligence). It uses 
  the [https://pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) service to respond with 
  different “models”.

  A model is a trained “version” of an AI. They all have a way of processing information
  and rendering it. Depending on your request, a model may not respond efficiently.

  This application can also be used to generate images.

  ## How to use the application

  Simply type a question and press the “Enter” key, the template selected in the 
  “Models” menu will then be used to answer that question. If you want to 
  change the template, use the “Templates” menu and select the one you want.

  > Each template has its own way of responding to your requests. Please note 
  that some are marked with a 🔞 symbol, which means they are not censored.

  ## Image generation

  PolAIn detects when you request an image. In this case, it will help the AI to 
  create an image address on the service 
  (https://images.pollinsations.ai)[https://images.pollinsations.ai] - the image 
  will be generated and displayed in the conversation.
