# Do not edit JSON files

Translation is built from `locales/*.yaml` files. If you want to help on translation, please fork the project and edit the `locales/xx.yaml` file, with `xx` the "2 letters" language code (en, fr, es, it...).

Then create a pull-request with your translation.

Thanks a lot!
